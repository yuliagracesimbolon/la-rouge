          <p class="card-text"></p>
            <P>Description <br>Comets reflect light with great intensity. 
            They follow their own trajectory and never fade away in the eye of the beholder.
            A symbol of good luck, the star with 5 irregular points inspired Coco Chanel's first and only High Jewellery collection.
            Today, a comet comes into view on the iconic ROUGE ALLURE VELVET 
            case and leaves its radiant mark on each lip colour.
            8 limited-edition exclusive creations with a new,
            delicately pearly matte finish and luminous sculpting effect.
            Composition <br>
            • Ultra-fine, pure, and highly concentrated pigments for intense color <br>
            • A combination of soft-focus microspheres and ultra-fine pearly particles for a finish that is both matte and luminous <br>
            • A jojoba oil derivative for smooth lips. <br>
            How to Use <br>
            Apply directly to the lips. <br>
            For perfectly defined lips, wear ROUGE ALLURE VELVET with LE CRAYON LÈVRES liner in the same shade. 
            Then, apply the lipstick using the brush from the lip pencil.
